# Halo Agent Evaluation Framework

This repository houses the comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for rigorously testing and benchmarking the capabilities of **Halo**, our internal AI Agents framework. The core Halo agent logic and implementation reside in the `clear-route/halo` repository.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this framework is to:
*   **Assess Agent Performance:** Measure the efficiency, speed, and resourcefulness of Halo agents across a diverse set of tasks.
*   **Verify Correctness:** Ensure that agents produce accurate, reliable, and high-quality outcomes according to specified requirements.
*   **Track Capability Advancement:** Benchmark different versions and configurations of Halo agents to monitor progress and identify areas for enhancement.
*   **Drive Development:** Provide a standardized suite of tests that guide the ongoing development and improvement of the Halo AI agent ecosystem.

## Structure

This repository will contain various evaluation suites, test cases, datasets, and potentially automated scripts for executing evaluations and reporting results. The focus is on creating dynamic and complex problem scenarios that push the boundaries of agent abilities.

## Contribution

Feedback and contributions to this evaluation framework are welcome from the Halo development team to ensure its relevance and comprehensiveness.
